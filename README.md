# Personal Wealth Management

Self-hosted personal finance, bank statement processing, mail alerting, wealth tracking, and annual tax return (CoreTax SPT) system for a Mac Mini plus optional Synology NAS replica.

The system is local-first: the bridge runs on macOS for host-only capabilities, the finance API and PWA run in Docker, bank statement PDFs are parsed into `output/xls/ALL_TRANSACTIONS.xlsx`, and `data/finance.db` is the authoritative edited finance store. Mail-agent runtime state, including Phase 4A mail rules and audit events, lives in `data/agent.db`.

## What It Does

| Area | Summary |
|---|---|
| Mail alerts | Dockerized mail agent polls configured IMAP accounts or the bridge fallback, classifies through registered providers, and sends iMessage alerts through the Mac bridge. |
| PDF processing | Processes local bank PDFs from `data/pdf_inbox` / `data/pdf_unlocked` through bridge jobs; IMAP PDF attachments can be unlocked through bridge `/pdf/unlock` and routed to `/mnt/mailagent` when the NAS mount sentinel is valid. |
| Finance import | Imports `ALL_TRANSACTIONS.xlsx` into SQLite with hash-based deduplication and guarded parser-variant reconciliation. |
| Wealth tracking | Stores balances, holdings, liabilities, and net worth snapshots. |
| CoreTax SPT | Persistent tax-version ledger: import prior-year SPT XLSX, carry forward manual decisions, map PWM sources before reconcile, auto-reconcile refreshable rows from live wealth data, preserve component history, export to CoreTax XLSX template. |
| Matching engine | Shared `finance/matching/` infrastructure for auditable mappings, confidence, rejected suggestions, shadow diffs, and matching-console APIs. |
| PWA | Vue 3 dashboard for transactions, wealth, assets, CoreTax SPT wizard, review queue, audit, and settings. |
| Mail dashboard | Electron + React menu-bar app under `mail-dashboard/` that reads dashboard mail APIs on `127.0.0.1:8090/api/mail/*`; worker health/debug remains on `127.0.0.1:8080`. |
| NAS services | Optional read-only finance API/PWA replica plus LAN-only Household Expense PWA. |

## Quick Start

### Mail Agent & Dashboard
1. **Start Bridge (Host):** `PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m bridge.server` (or `./scripts/run_bridge.sh`)
2. **Start Agent (Docker):** `docker compose up -d mail-agent` (or `./scripts/start_agent.sh`)
3. **Open Dashboard:**
   ```bash
   cd mail-dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

### Finance API & PWA
1. **Start API:** `docker compose up -d finance-api` (or `python3 -m finance.server`)
2. **Open PWA:**
   ```bash
   cd pwa
   npm run dev
   ```

### Status & Verification
- **Mail Status:** `python3 scripts/mailagent_status.py --no-run`
- **Preflight:** `python3 scripts/mailagent_preflight.py`

## Status

- Stage 1 mail alerting: active
- Stage 1 IMAP intake and attachment routing: implemented; enabled when `[mail.imap].accounts` contains real accounts, otherwise the bridge mail source remains the fallback
- Native mail dashboard: implemented and buildable; talks to dashboard mail APIs on local port `8090`
- Stage 2 finance import and PWA: active
- Stage 3 wealth management: active
- CoreTax SPT mapping-first ledger and wizard: active
- Generic matching engine foundation: active; parser/dedup/categorization engine paths are flag-gated while legacy paths remain available
- PDF preflight and per-file status lifecycle: active
- NAS read-only replica: configured for deployments that enable NAS sync
- NAS mail-agent PDF archive: requires `/Volumes/Synology/mailagent` mounted and shared with Docker as `/mnt/mailagent`
- Household Expense PWA: active as a LAN-only NAS satellite app

Private project.
