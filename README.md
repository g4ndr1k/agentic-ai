# Personal Wealth Management

Self-hosted personal finance, bank statement processing, mail alerting, wealth tracking, and annual tax return (CoreTax SPT) system for a Mac Mini plus optional Synology NAS replica.

The system is local-first: the bridge runs on macOS for host-only capabilities, the finance API and PWA run in Docker, bank statement PDFs are parsed into `output/xls/ALL_TRANSACTIONS.xlsx`, and `data/finance.db` is the authoritative edited store.

## What It Does

| Area | Summary |
|---|---|
| Mail alerts | Polls financial mail, classifies through registered providers, and sends iMessage alerts. |
| PDF processing | Processes local bank PDFs from `data/pdf_inbox` / `data/pdf_unlocked` through bridge jobs. |
| Finance import | Imports `ALL_TRANSACTIONS.xlsx` into SQLite with hash-based deduplication and guarded parser-variant reconciliation. |
| Wealth tracking | Stores balances, holdings, liabilities, and net worth snapshots. |
| CoreTax SPT | Persistent tax-version ledger: import prior-year SPT XLSX, carry forward manual decisions, map PWM sources before reconcile, auto-reconcile refreshable rows from live wealth data, preserve component history, export to CoreTax XLSX template. |
| Matching engine | Shared `finance/matching/` infrastructure for auditable mappings, confidence, rejected suggestions, shadow diffs, and matching-console APIs. |
| PWA | Vue 3 dashboard for transactions, wealth, assets, CoreTax SPT wizard, review queue, audit, and settings. |
| NAS services | Optional read-only finance API/PWA replica plus LAN-only Household Expense PWA. |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Finance API
python3 -m finance.server

# Bridge on the Mac host
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m bridge.server

# PWA development
cd pwa
npm install
npm run dev

# Production containers
docker compose up --build -d
```
