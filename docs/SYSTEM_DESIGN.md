# System Design

Stable architecture blueprint for the Agentic AI personal finance and mail alert system.

Operational commands live in [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md). Symptom-driven fixes live in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Change history lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Design rationale lives in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## System Overview

The project runs as separate cooperating processes:

```text
Mac host
  bridge/                 host Python service on :9100
    mail/iMessage access
    PDF processing jobs
    bridge API

Docker on Mac
  agent/                  mail alert worker
  finance/ + pwa/dist     FastAPI + built Vue PWA on :8090

Optional NAS
  finance API replica     read-only copy of data/finance.db
  household-expense/      LAN-only household expense satellite app
```

Primary data path:

```text
Bank PDFs
  -> bridge/pdf_handler.py
  -> parsers/router.py and bank parser
  -> exporters/xls_writer.py
  -> output/xls/ALL_TRANSACTIONS.xlsx
  -> finance/importer.py
  -> data/finance.db
  -> finance/api.py
  -> pwa/
```

## Bridge, API, And PWA Responsibilities

The bridge owns host-only capabilities: iMessage, macOS-local files, PDF parsing jobs, and bridge health. It exposes `/pdf/*` endpoints for preflight, queueing, status, and recent jobs.

The finance API owns application data and user-facing HTTP routes. It proxies PDF routes from `/api/pdf/*` to bridge `/pdf/*`, preserving meaningful bridge failures instead of converting them into generic success.

The PWA owns user workflows. Settings -> Process Local PDFs runs preflight first, queues all selected or ready files, polls each job, and reports per-file `done`, `partial`, or `error` results.

## Household Expense Satellite

The Household Expense PWA is an implemented LAN-only satellite service under `household-expense/`. It lets household staff record daily cash expenses from an Android/browser PWA while keeping those records in a separate NAS-local SQLite database.

Current NAS automation defaults:

- SSH user: `chfun`
- SSH port: `22`
- Finance replica sync target: `chfun@192.168.1.44:/volume1/finance/finance_readonly.db`
- Local deploy scripts read the Synology sudo password from `secrets/nas_sudo_password`

Runtime shape:

```text
Android phone / browser
  -> http://192.168.1.44:8088
  -> household-expense FastAPI + static Vue PWA
  -> household.db on NAS

Mac finance PWA Settings
  -> finance/api.py /api/household/*
  -> household API on NAS
```

Responsibilities:

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `household-expense/api/main.py` | FastAPI app, CORS, startup, health, static PWA mount. |
| `household-expense/api/auth.py` | Assistant session cookie and API key verification. |
| `household-expense/api/db.py` | `household.db` schema and SQLite pragmas. |
| `household-expense/api/routers/transactions.py` | Expense CRUD and soft-delete. |
| `household-expense/api/routers/categories.py` | Category CRUD and category renames. |
| `household-expense/api/routers/cash_pools.py` | Cash pool CRUD and balance adjustments. |
| `household-expense/api/routers/export.py` | Unreconciled export and reconcile marking. |
| `household-expense/pwa/` | Assistant UI routes: login, add expense, history. |

The household app does not write directly to `data/finance.db`. The main finance API exposes `/api/household/*` proxy/admin endpoints so the main Settings page can manage household categories, recent expenses, and cash pools.

## PDF Processing Flow

```text
Settings.vue
  GET /api/pdf/preflight
  POST /api/pdf/process-local
  GET /api/pdf/local-status/{job_id}

finance/api.py
  reads bridge token
  proxies to bridge
  preserves HTTP errors and response body

bridge/pdf_handler.py
  validates local path
  queues job
  unlocks PDF if needed
  detects parser
  parses statement
  writes secondary balances/holdings where applicable
  exports XLS
  imports XLS into SQLite for manual jobs
  records processed file registry
```

Preflight validates bridge initialization, folders, provider order, database connectivity, and runtime diagnostics before any processing work starts.

## Status Lifecycle

Backend constants in `bridge/pdf_handler.py`:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Job queued and waiting for worker. |
| `running` | Worker is processing the job. |
| `done` | Parse, export, secondary writes, and import completed. |
| `partial` | Main parse/export succeeded, but secondary balance/holding writes failed. |
| `error` | Parse, export, import, config, path, or runtime failure. |

Frontend constants in `pwa/src/utils/pdfFormatters.js` mirror this vocabulary. `missing_source` is a normalized API/UI status for registry rows whose original PDF no longer exists.

Contracts:

- `partial` must not display as full success.
- `error + "no such file"` normalizes to `missing_source`, not `done`.
- `pending`, `running`, `done`, `partial`, `error`, and `missing_source` are not processable from the UI.
- Batch processing attempts all queued files unless aborted.
- Partial success must be reported as partial success in API/UI state.

## Parser Architecture

Parser extraction logic is separated from job/status orchestration:

```text
parsers/router.py
  detect_bank_and_type()
  detect_and_parse()

parsers/base.py
  Transaction
  StatementResult

parsers/<bank>_<type>.py
  extraction logic only
```

Parsers return structured statement results. The bridge handles unlocking, verification, export, secondary writes, job persistence, and UI-visible status.

## Provider And Classifier Architecture

Provider names are centralized in `agent/app/providers/__init__.py`:

```python
PROVIDERS = {
    "rule_based": RuleBasedProvider,
    "ollama": OllamaProvider,
}
```

`agent/app/classifier.py` raises on unknown provider names. `bridge/pdf_handler.py` preflight uses the same provider registry when available and falls back to the same provider names if import context is unavailable.

Current production provider order is `["rule_based"]`. `rule_based` is a supported provider and must pass config validation.

## Database And Storage Overview

| Path/Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `output/xls/ALL_TRANSACTIONS.xlsx` | Immutable parser output used to rebuild SQLite. |
| `data/finance.db` | Authoritative edited finance store. |
| `transactions` | Raw imported transaction rows keyed by hash. |
| `category_overrides` | User edits that survive re-import. |
| `transactions_resolved` | View merging base rows with overrides. |
| `merchant_aliases` | Exact, contains, and regex categorization rules. |
| `categories` | Category metadata and grouping. |
| `account_balances` | Cash and account balances by snapshot date. |
| `holdings` | Investments and other assets by snapshot date. |
| `liabilities` | Credit cards, loans, and other liabilities. |
| `net_worth_snapshots` | Aggregated monthly net worth rows. |
| `data/coretax/templates/` | User-placed CoreTax XLSX templates (e.g. `CoreTax 2025.xlsx`). |
| `data/coretax/output/` | Filled CoreTax outputs: `CoreTax_YEAR_SNAP_vN.xlsx` + `.audit.json` sidecars. |
| `data/pdf_jobs.db` | Bridge PDF job state. |
| `data/processed_files.db` | Processed PDF registry keyed by SHA-256. |
| `household-expense/data/household.db` | Separate household expense store on NAS deployment. |
| `household_transactions` | Household expense records, soft-delete flag, reconciliation status. |
| `household_categories` | Household category codes and Indonesian labels. |
| `cash_pools` | Cash envelopes / ATM-funded pools and remaining balances. |

`finance/importer.py` validates the XLSX header before positional import. Header mismatches are fatal because shifted columns can corrupt data silently.

## Important API Contracts

Bridge:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Unauthenticated liveness. |
| `GET` | `/health` | Authenticated bridge health. |

| `POST` | `/api/coretax/generate` | Fill CoreTax template from PWM data. Body: `{template, snapshot_date, dry_run}`. `dry_run=true` returns JSON audit trace only (no file written, works under `FINANCE_READ_ONLY=true`). `dry_run=false` returns filled XLSX as download and writes output + audit JSON sidecar. |
| `GET` | `/api/coretax/audit/{filename}` | Return the audit JSON sidecar for a previously generated file. |

### Financial Statement Report

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/reports/financial-statement?start_month=YYYY-MM&end_month=YYYY-MM&owner=<optional>`
- **UI entry point**: PWA → CoreTax SPT view → *Reporting Period* card → **Generate Financial Statements** button (opens `FinancialStatementModal.vue`). Previously in Settings; moved to the CoreTax SPT view so the same reporting period drives both the FS and the CoreTax export.
- **Source data**: composes existing helpers — `_get_monthly_summary_data` for per-month income/expense and `net_worth_snapshots`/`account_balances`/`holdings`/`liabilities` rows for opening + closing dates. The endpoint never writes; it requires no DB migration.
- **Read-only behavior**: pure GET, no `require_writable` dep, so the NAS replica serves it identically.
- **Warning policy**: any missing snapshot, uncategorised transactions, owner-filter limitation, or material mismatch between net-worth movement and recorded cash flow is appended to a `warnings[]` array. Missing data must never be returned as a silent zero.
- **Print / PDF**: the modal uses `window.print()` plus a scoped `@media print` stylesheet — no PDF dependency.

Household API:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/household/health` | Unauthenticated household health check. |
| `POST` | `/api/household/auth/login` | Assistant login and session cookie. |
| `POST` | `/api/household/auth/logout` | Clear session. |

| `PUT/DELETE` | `/api/household/categories/{code}` | Update or soft-disable household category. |
| `GET/POST` | `/api/household/cash-pools` | List/create cash pools. |
| `PUT` | `/api/household/cash-pools/{id}` | Update cash pool or apply adjustment. |
| `GET` | `/api/household/export/unreconciled` | Export pending household transactions. |
| `POST` | `/api/household/reconcile` | Mark household transactions reconciled. |

## Security Boundaries

- Bridge bearer token protects bridge routes except `/healthz`.
- Finance API uses `X-Api-Key`.
- Private surfaces are intended to sit behind Cloudflare Access or local/private networking.
- Secret source of truth is macOS Keychain; files under `secrets/` are Docker export artifacts.
- `VITE_FINANCE_API_KEY` is embedded in the PWA bundle; do not reuse that key outside this deployment boundary.

## Stale Or Removed Content

The old root `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` mixed architecture, operations, troubleshooting, implementation history, and command logs. That content has been split across the docs set. Historical setup snippets that referenced fixed Python executable paths are intentionally not copied here; operations docs now prefer `python3` or the dynamic scripts.
