## 2026-04-25 — CoreTax SPT Generator

- Added `finance/coretax_export.py` — maps PWM `account_balances` (savings) and `holdings` (investments) to an Indonesian DJP CoreTax XLSX template.
- Column F (closing value) filled from `balance_idr` for savings rows (kode 012) and `cost_basis_idr` for investment rows (kode 034/036/039). Column G filled from `market_value_idr` for investments. Hard-asset rows (real estate, vehicles, gold) are left untouched.
- Per-row audit trace: every filled cell is traceable back to a specific PWM source row. Unmatched, aggregated, and currency-warning rows are surfaced explicitly — no silent zeros.
- `investment_match_mode = "strict"` (default) requires `(institution, asset_class, owner)` match. `"aggregate_with_warning"` sums across institutions with a trace warning.
- Non-IDR holdings are filled via `*_idr` columns with a `currency_warning` status so the user can verify.
- Output written to `data/coretax/output/CoreTax_YEAR_SNAPSHOT_vN.xlsx` with a `<same-name>.audit.json` sidecar. Version number auto-increments to avoid overwriting reviewed runs.
- Added three API endpoints: `GET /api/coretax/templates`, `POST /api/coretax/generate` (supports `dry_run=true` for JSON preview), `GET /api/coretax/audit/{filename}`.
- Generate endpoint returns the filled XLSX as a download when `dry_run=false`; blocked under `FINANCE_READ_ONLY=true`. Dry-run is always available.
- New PWA view `/coretax` (CoreTax SPT) with four cards: Reporting Period, Generate Financial Statement (moved from Settings), CoreTax SPT Template picker, and Generate CoreTax SPT.
- Preview (dry-run) button shows confidence breakdown before the user commits to a file download.
- Generate XLSX button disabled until at least one preview has been run.
- `[coretax]`, `[coretax.owner_aliases]`, and `[coretax.institution_aliases]` added to `config/settings.toml`. Owner and institution mappings are config-driven so they can be updated without code changes.
- Docker env vars `CORETAX_TEMPLATE_DIR` and `CORETAX_OUTPUT_DIR` added to `docker-compose.yml` to map container paths independently of host-absolute settings.toml paths.
- 8 unit tests added in `tests/test_coretax_export.py` covering normalisation, parsing, institution/owner canonicalisation, strict vs aggregate matching, currency warnings, template validation, and unused PWM rows.

## 2026-04-25 — Documentation Split And PDF Hardening Follow-up

- Refactored project documentation into purpose-specific docs:
  - `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
  - `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
  - `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
  - `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
  - `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Kept root `README.md` short and moved detailed operations/troubleshooting elsewhere.
- Merged Household Expense implementation details into core docs and removed the standalone household plan.
- Added fail-fast XLSX header validation in `finance/importer.py` so shifted columns cannot import positionally.

## 2026-04-25 — PDF Preflight And Silent Failure Hardening

- Added bridge `GET /pdf/preflight`.
- Added finance API `GET /api/pdf/preflight` proxy.
- Added PWA `api.pdfPreflight`.
- Settings -> Process Local PDFs now runs preflight before queueing work.
- Preflight errors and warnings are shown in the UI.
- Bridge token errors now fail clearly when token path is missing, empty, or a directory.
- API proxy preserves meaningful bridge errors.
- PDF service worker routes are network-only/freshness-forced to avoid stale processing state.
- PDF statuses now include shared `pending`, `running`, `done`, `partial`, and `error` vocabulary.
- Partial success is reported separately from success.
- Missing source PDFs normalize to `missing_source`.
- `provider_order = ["rule_based"]` is accepted because `rule_based` is a registered provider.
- Stale Python path references in app/launch scripts were replaced with dynamic resolution.
- Secret export writes `secrets/bridge.token` as a file with mode `600` and removes stale token directories.
