# Mail Agent

Single source of truth for the local Mac Mini mail-agent, native mail-dashboard, Gmail IMAP intake, macOS bridge integration, and Phase 4 mail rules roadmap.

This document consolidates mail-agent material that was previously spread across the system design, operations, troubleshooting, changelog, preflight, and legacy mail-agent notes.

Keep the high-level architecture summary in `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`, keep command-only runbooks in `OPERATIONS.md`, keep symptom-specific fixes in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, and keep this file as the detailed mail-agent reference.

data/finance.db = PWM / finance data only
```

Do not put mail rules in `finance.db`.

---

## Architecture

```text
Gmail IMAP account or bridge fallback
  -> Docker mail-agent (`agent/`)
  -> deterministic rules engine in `data/agent.db`
  -> local classifier providers
  -> bridge iMessage / PDF unlock on Mac host
  -> optional NAS PDF archive at `/mnt/mailagent`
  -> native Electron dashboard (`mail-dashboard/`)
```

Runtime placement:

```text
Mac host
  bridge/server.py          :9100
    - iMessage
    - host-local PDF unlock / PDF processing
    - bridge health

Docker on Mac
  mail-agent                :8080
    - polling / scan loop
    - IMAP intake
    - rule evaluation
    - classifier providers
    - attachment routing
    - local health/debug API

  finance-api               :8090
    - PWA backend
    - mounts `agent.app.api_mail`
    - exposes dashboard-facing `/api/mail/*`

Native app
  mail-dashboard/
    - Electron menu-bar UI
    - talks to `127.0.0.1:8090/api/mail/*`
```

The dashboard is a control surface only. Quitting the dashboard must not stop mail processing.

---

## Main Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `agent/app/orchestrator.py` | Chooses IMAP or bridge fallback, enforces safety mode, runs rule/classifier flow, advances checkpoints after durable processing. |
| `agent/app/imap_source.py` | Gmail IMAP polling, UID/UIDVALIDITY state, bounded lookback, size guards, message identity, attachment metadata. |
| `agent/app/rules.py` | Phase 4A deterministic rules evaluator. |
| `agent/app/state.py` | SQLite migrations and helpers for `data/agent.db`. |
| `agent/app/pdf_router.py` | Sends PDF bytes to bridge `/pdf/unlock`, validates filenames, checks NAS sentinel, routes attachments. |
| `agent/app/net_guard.py` | Outbound, bridge, IMAP, and NAS readiness probes. |
| `agent/app/api_mail.py` | Mail dashboard API router mounted by finance API. |
| `agent/app/config_manager.py` | Account config persistence and atomic/fallback TOML writes. |
| `bridge/server.py` | Host-only bridge routes including `/pdf/unlock`, `/alerts/send`, `/health`, and `/healthz`. |
| `mail-dashboard/` | Electron + React + Tailwind native dashboard. |
| `scripts/mailagent_preflight.py` | Read-only inventory and sanity report. |
| `scripts/mailagent_status.py` | CLI smoke test for mail APIs. |

---

## API Boundaries

There are two different local API surfaces. Keep them separate.

### Dashboard-facing API

The native dashboard uses the finance API mount:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/mail/*
```

Supported account/settings endpoints:

```text
GET    /api/mail/summary
GET    /api/mail/recent?limit=20
GET    /api/mail/accounts
POST   /api/mail/accounts/test
POST   /api/mail/accounts
PATCH  /api/mail/accounts/{account_id}
PATCH  /api/mail/accounts/{account_id}/enabled
DELETE /api/mail/accounts/{account_id}
POST   /api/mail/accounts/{account_id}/reactivate
POST   /api/mail/config/reload
POST   /api/mail/run
```

Rules endpoints should also live under this same `/api/mail/*` namespace.

Current rules endpoints:

```text
GET    /api/mail/rules
POST   /api/mail/rules
GET    /api/mail/rules/{rule_id}
PATCH  /api/mail/rules/{rule_id}
DELETE /api/mail/rules/{rule_id}
PUT    /api/mail/rules/reorder
POST   /api/mail/rules/preview
GET    /api/mail/processing-events
```

### Worker health/debug API

The mail-agent container exposes:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Use this for local status/debug, not as the dashboard settings surface.

---

## Secrets And Credentials

Source of truth:

```text
macOS Keychain
```

Docker fallback file:

```text
secrets/imap.toml -> mounted read-only as /app/secrets/imap.toml
```

Expected `secrets/imap.toml` shape:

```toml
[[accounts]]
email = "user@gmail.com"
app_password = "xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
```

Required local permission:

```bash
chmod 600 secrets/imap.toml
```

Hard rules:

- Never commit `secrets/imap.toml`.
- Never commit `scripts/export-finance-key.sh`.
- Do not paste App Passwords into docs, prompts, screenshots, logs, or Git.
- Dashboard/backend should normalize Gmail App Password whitespace before testing or saving.
- Placeholder accounts such as `YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com` must be ignored by runtime and filtered from the dashboard.

---

## Gmail IMAP Intake

IMAP is enabled only when `[mail.imap].accounts` contains real enabled accounts. If only placeholders exist, the agent should continue using the bridge fallback.

Account state is tracked per account/folder:

```text
(account_id, folder, last_uid, uidvalidity)
```

Message identity:

```text
message_key          = sha256(account + folder + normalized Message-ID)
fallback_message_key = sha256(account + folder + uidvalidity + uid)
attachment_key       = sha256(message_key + sha256(pdf_bytes))
```

Checkpoint rule:

```text
Advance IMAP checkpoint only after message result is persisted and attachment rows are created or processed.
```

A PDF routing failure must not force refetch of the same email forever.

---

## Safety Modes

Configured under `[agent].mode`.

| Mode | Fetch + classify | iMessage | PDF route | Email mutation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `observe` | yes | no | no | no |
| `draft_only` | yes | yes | yes | no |
| `live` | yes | yes | yes | yes |

Current safe operating assumption:

```text
mode = draft_only
```

Invalid or missing mode resolves to `draft_only`, or `observe` when `[agent].safe_default = "observe"`.

Blocked actions must be recorded as `mode_blocked` events.

---

## PDF Attachment Routing

The agent must never pass container-local file paths to the bridge. It sends PDF bytes to bridge `/pdf/unlock` as multipart data, then receives unlocked bytes and metadata headers.

Required NAS routing setup:

```text
Host mount:   /Volumes/Synology/mailagent
Docker mount: /Volumes/Synology/mailagent:/mnt/mailagent
Sentinel:     /mnt/mailagent/.mailagent_mount
Config:       [mail_agent.pdf].mount_sentinel_uuid
```

Before writing attachments, `pdf_router.py` must verify:

- NAS mount exists.
- Sentinel exists.
- Sentinel UUID matches config.
- Write/delete probe succeeds.

If any check fails, attachment jobs should stay pending/retryable. Do not write into ephemeral container storage.

---

## Phase 4A Rules Engine

Phase 4A is deterministic and read-only from the mailbox perspective. It runs before classifier/AI logic and uses SQLite state in `data/agent.db`.

### Tables

```text
mail_rules
mail_rule_conditions
mail_rule_actions
mail_processing_events
mail_needs_reply
```

Future AI tables also stay in `data/agent.db`:

```text
mail_ai_queue
mail_ai_classifications
mail_ai_categories
mail_ai_trigger_rules
```

### SQLite Connection Contract

Every connection opened by `state.py` or new helpers should run:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
```

`journal_mode=WAL` is database-level and persistent. `foreign_keys` and `busy_timeout` are per-connection and must be set every time.

### Evaluator Semantics

Rules are evaluated in ascending priority.

Global rules and account-specific rules can interleave by priority. Priority uniqueness should treat `NULL` global account scope explicitly, for example through `COALESCE(account_id, '__global__')`.

Match behavior:

```text
match_type = ALL or ANY
enabled = 0 means skipped
stop_processing = halt later deterministic rules after current rule actions finish
skip_ai_inference = do not enqueue future AI inference
```

Each action should log an outcome to `mail_processing_events`. One action failure must not erase prior successful action logs.

### Phase 4A Safe Actions And Phase 4C.1 Mutation Primitives

Allowed in Phase 4A:

```text
mark_pending_alert
skip_ai_inference
add_to_needs_reply
route_to_pdf_pipeline
notify_dashboard
stop_processing
```

Recognized in Phase 4C.1, but gated by `[agent].mode` and `[mail.imap_mutations]`:

```text
move_to_folder
mark_read
mark_unread
mark_flagged
unmark_flagged
```

Still not allowed:

```text
add_label
send_imessage
delete
auto_reply
forward
unsubscribe
external_webhook
```

Do not expose unsafe actions in the dashboard until explicitly requested and implemented with capability checks, audit, and safety mode enforcement.

End-to-end Phase 4A verification has confirmed real mail processing with deterministic rules:

```text
phase4a_scan_summary messages_seen=3 messages_evaluator_ran=3 rules_matched=3 events_written=3
```

---

## Phase 4B AI Enrichment — Read-Only

Phase 4B is implemented as an opt-in, read-only AI triage layer. It runs after deterministic rule evaluation, enqueues eligible messages in `mail_ai_queue`, and stores validated Ollama output in `mail_ai_classifications`.

Default config:

```toml
[mail.ai]
enabled = false
provider = "ollama"
base_url = "http://host.docker.internal:11434"
model = "gemma3:4b"
temperature = 0.1
timeout_seconds = 45
max_body_chars = 12000
urgency_threshold = 8
```

Operational constraints:

- AI enrichment does not mutate email.
- Ollama calls happen outside DB transactions.
- Output is schema-validated before persistence.
- Validation failure writes `status='failed'` and `last_error`; no trigger fires.
- One in-flight Ollama request is enough for v1.
- Manual reprocess uses `manual_nonce` so it does not collide with existing queue uniqueness.
- AI enrichment still does not invoke mutation helpers or trigger actions.

---

## Phase 4C.1 IMAP Mutation Primitives

Phase 4C.1 adds infrastructure-level IMAP primitives only. It does not add AI-triggered actions, bulk mutation, auto-reply, forwarding, unsubscribe, webhooks, delete/expunge as a user-facing action, or AI-triggered iMessage.

Default config:

```toml
[mail.imap_mutations]
enabled = false
allow_create_folder = false
allow_copy_delete_fallback = false
dry_run_default = true
```

Safety constraints:

- `observe` and `draft_only` always audit `mode_blocked`.
- `live` still requires `[mail.imap_mutations].enabled = true`.
- UIDVALIDITY is rechecked before any UID mutation.
- MOVE uses `UID MOVE` when supported.
- COPY + STORE `\Deleted` fallback is disabled by default and never calls EXPUNGE in this phase.
- STORE supports only `\Seen` and `\Flagged`.
- Every planned, blocked, dry-run, unsupported, completed, or failed mutation path writes `mail_processing_events`.

---

## Phase 4C.3A AI Trigger Actions — Preview-Only

AI triggers are deterministic rules evaluated after validated Phase 4B AI classifications are saved. They use `mail_ai_trigger_rules` and write `ai_trigger_matched` rows to `mail_processing_events`.

Supported trigger fields:

```text
category
urgency_score
confidence
needs_reply
summary
reason
```

Supported preview-only actions:

```text
notify_dashboard
send_imessage
move_to_folder
mark_read
mark_flagged
add_to_needs_reply
```

Safety constraints:

- Trigger matching is deterministic and never calls another LLM.
- All AI-trigger actions are forced to `dry_run=true`.
- AI triggers never call IMAP mutation helpers, bridge `send_alert`, auto-reply, forwarding, delete, expunge, unsubscribe, or webhooks in this phase.
- Trigger evaluation failure is audited separately and must not mark the AI classification as failed.
- Dashboard copy must clearly label AI triggers as preview-only.

---

## Phase 4D.1 Control Center — Operator Approval

Phase 4D.1 inserts a human approval queue between AI trigger suggestions and any execution attempt.

Default config:

```toml
[mail.approvals]
enabled = true
require_approval_for_ai_actions = true
approval_expiry_hours = 72
started_stale_after_minutes = 30
allow_bulk_approve = false
```

Safety constraints:

- AI triggers create `mail_action_approvals` rows; they do not execute actions.
- Operators approve or reject suggestions in the dashboard Control Center.
- Approval and execution are separate API operations.
- Approval does not bypass `[agent].mode`, `[mail.imap_mutations].enabled`, `dry_run_default`, UIDVALIDITY, folder, or IMAP capability checks.
- `send_imessage`, reply, forward, delete, expunge, unsubscribe, and webhooks remain blocked in this phase.
- Bulk approval is not implemented.

Approval API:

```text
GET  /api/mail/approvals
GET  /api/mail/approvals/{approval_id}
POST /api/mail/approvals/{approval_id}/approve
POST /api/mail/approvals/{approval_id}/reject
POST /api/mail/approvals/{approval_id}/execute
POST /api/mail/approvals/{approval_id}/expire
```

Execution support in this phase is limited to safe mailbox action attempts through the existing gated mutation path plus `add_to_needs_reply`. Unsupported approved actions are marked `blocked` and audited.

Approval detail responses include derived `execution_state`, `expires_at`, `approved_at`, `execution_started_at`, `execution_finished_at`, `blocked_reason`, `execution_error`, `gate_result`, `audit_event_ids`, and chronological `events`. The operator-facing states are `not_requested`, `started`, `executed`, `blocked`, `failed`, `expired`, `rejected`, and `stuck`.

`stuck` is read-only detection for approvals that reached `execution_status='started'` but did not finish before `started_stale_after_minutes`. The optional mark-failed endpoint is valid only for stale started approvals and records an audit event without retrying execution.

Phase 4D.3 adds read-only preview fields to list and detail responses: `preview_title`, `preview_summary`, `message_context`, `trigger_context`, `rule_context`, `risk_level`, `risk_reasons`, `reversibility`, `operator_guidance`, `would_execute_now`, `would_be_blocked_now`, and `current_gate_preview`. These fields are for operator review only. They do not approve, reserve, start, retry, or execute an action.

The Control Center should be read before approval: confirm why the item appeared, what trigger/rule matched, which sender/subject/account/folder/UID is affected, what action/target/value is proposed, and whether the current gate says dry-run, blocked by config, unsupported, terminal, stale/manual-review, or statically ready. `capability='unknown'` is expected when preview cannot know IMAP capabilities cheaply without a live mailbox transaction.

Phase 4D.4 adds lifecycle hygiene:

```text
GET  /api/mail/approvals/cleanup/preview
POST /api/mail/approvals/cleanup
POST /api/mail/approvals/{approval_id}/archive
POST /api/mail/approvals/{approval_id}/unarchive
GET  /api/mail/approvals/export?format=json
```

Cleanup is disabled by default. The preview is read-only. Explicit cleanup may expire old pending approvals and archive old terminal approvals, but started/stuck approvals are excluded and hard delete is not used in this phase. Archive hides terminal approvals from the active Control Center; audit history remains retained and exportable. JSON export includes sanitized approval/message context and optional events, not raw email bodies or secrets.

---

## Transaction And I/O Boundary

Hard rule:

```text
No DB transaction may remain open across IMAP, Ollama, bridge, network, or filesystem I/O.
```

Required pattern:

```text
1. Open short transaction -> claim work -> commit.
2. Run external I/O outside any transaction.
3. Open short transaction -> persist result/audit/error -> commit.
```

This avoids SQLite writer contention and protects wake/retry behavior.

---

## Common Commands

Start bridge on Mac host:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m bridge.server
```

Start/rebuild mail agent:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d mail-agent
docker compose logs -f mail-agent
```

Run status checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/mailagent_preflight.py
python3 scripts/mailagent_status.py --no-run
python3 scripts/mailagent_status.py
```

Run dashboard locally:

```bash
cd mail-dashboard
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

After Python changes, rebuild the relevant Docker image. Restart alone may not pick up code baked into the image.

---

## Quick Verification Checklist

```bash
# 1. Config syntax
python3 -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('config/settings.toml','rb')); print('OK')"

# 2. Provider registry
python3 -c "from agent.app.providers import PROVIDERS; print(sorted(PROVIDERS))"

# 3. Docker status
docker compose ps

# 4. Mail-agent logs
docker compose logs --tail=120 mail-agent

# 5. Finance API logs, needed because dashboard mail APIs mount there
docker compose logs --tail=120 finance-api

# 6. Mail status
python3 scripts/mailagent_status.py --no-run

# 7. Preflight
python3 scripts/mailagent_preflight.py
```

Expected provider baseline:

```text
rule_based must be accepted as a supported classifier provider.
```

## Phase 4 Release Operator Checklist

Use this checklist before a Phase 4A through Phase 4C.3A checkpoint:

```bash
# 1. Read-only inventory and environment sanity
python3 scripts/mailagent_preflight.py

# 2. Authenticated API status without triggering a scan
python3 scripts/mailagent_status.py --no-run

# 3. Verify AI settings through the dashboard API
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/mail/ai/settings | python3 -m json.tool

# 4. Test AI classification without queueing or mutating mail
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/mail/ai/test \
  -d '{"sender":"alerts@example.com","subject":"Payment due reminder","body":"Your payment is due tomorrow."}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool

# 5. Preview deterministic rules; this endpoint is side-effect-free
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/mail/rules/preview \
  -d '{"sender":"alerts@example.com","subject":"Payment due reminder","body":"Your payment is due tomorrow."}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool

# 6. Preview AI triggers; planned actions must remain dry-run
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/mail/ai/triggers/preview \
  -d '{"category":"payment_due","urgency_score":8,"confidence":0.9,"needs_reply":false,"summary":"Payment due tomorrow","reason":"Due date detected"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

Default release posture:

- Keep `[mail.ai].enabled=false` unless deliberately validating read-only AI enrichment.
- Keep `[mail.imap_mutations].enabled=false` for the release checkpoint.
- Keep `[mail.imap_mutations].dry_run_default=true`; deterministic rule-managed mailbox actions should preview/audit unless intentionally promoted in `live`.
- Treat AI triggers as approval-only. They may write `ai_trigger_matched` audit events and pending Control Center approval items, but live autonomous AI-triggered actions are not enabled in Phase 4D.1.

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows connection error

Likely causes:

- `finance-api` did not mount `/api/mail/*`.
- `finance-api` lacks dependencies such as `tomlkit` or `keyring`.
- `mail-agent` is not running.
- NAS mount prevented the mail-agent container from starting.
- API key mismatch.

Commands:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=120 finance-api
docker compose logs --tail=120 mail-agent
python3 scripts/mailagent_status.py --no-run
```

Fix:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d finance-api mail-agent
export VITE_FINANCE_API_KEY="$FINANCE_API_KEY"
cd mail-dashboard
npm run dev
```

### Gmail account test fails with whitespace / ASCII error

Likely cause: pasted App Password contains spaces or non-breaking spaces.

Fix:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d finance-api
```

Then retry from the dashboard. Current code should strip whitespace automatically.

### Account saves but does not appear

Likely cause: invalid TOML shape under `[mail.imap].accounts` from an older writer.

Diagnose:

```bash
python3 -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('config/settings.toml','rb')); print('OK')"
```

Expected inline account style:

```toml
[mail.imap]
accounts = [
  {email = "user@gmail.com", provider = "gmail", id = "gmail_user", name = "User", host = "imap.gmail.com", port = 993, ssl = true, auth_type = "app_password", folders = ["INBOX"], lookback_days = 14, max_message_mb = 25, max_attachment_mb = 20, enabled = true, auth_source = "keychain", keychain_service = "agentic-ai-mail-imap"},
]
```

### Saving settings fails with `settings.tmp -> settings.toml` busy

Likely cause: Docker bind mount rejects atomic rename on single-file mount.

Fix:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d finance-api
```

Current code should use an in-place fsynced write fallback when atomic rename is blocked.

### Mail-agent container will not start after rebuild

Likely cause: NAS share missing or Docker Desktop cannot access `/Volumes`.

Diagnose:

```bash
ls -la /Volumes
ls -la /Volumes/Synology/mailagent
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=80 mail-agent
```

Fix:

```bash
# Mount Synology share first, then:
docker compose up --build -d mail-agent
python3 scripts/mailagent_status.py --no-run
```

### `data/agent.db` is malformed

Stop the agent first:

```bash
docker compose stop mail-agent
```

Create a timestamped copy before any repair attempt:

```bash
mkdir -p data/db_recovery
cp -a data/agent.db "data/db_recovery/agent.db.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).bak"
```

Run integrity check:

```bash
sqlite3 data/agent.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

Attempt recover into a new DB:

```bash
sqlite3 data/agent.db ".recover" | sqlite3 data/agent.recovered.db
sqlite3 data/agent.recovered.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

If recovered DB is OK:

```bash
mv data/agent.db "data/agent.db.bad.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mv data/agent.recovered.db data/agent.db
docker compose up --build -d mail-agent
```

If recovery fails, keep the backup and recreate only mail-agent runtime state. Do not touch `data/finance.db`.
