# Operations

How to run, validate, and maintain the system. Architecture details live in [SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](SYSTEM_DESIGN.md); symptom-driven fixes live in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Common Commands

### Bridge

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m bridge.server
```

The bridge runs on the Mac host, not inside Docker. It exposes `http://127.0.0.1:9100` or the configured host/port in `config/settings.toml`.

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9100/healthz
TOKEN=$(cat secrets/bridge.token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:9100/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Finance API

```bash
python3 -m finance.server
python3 -m finance.server --reload
```

Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f finance-api
```

Always rebuild the Docker image after Python changes. A container restart alone does not pick up changed source files baked into the image.

### PWA

```bash
cd pwa
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

`pwa/dist/` must exist before building production Docker images that serve the PWA from FastAPI.

### Household Expense PWA

```bash
cd household-expense/pwa
npm install
npm run build

cd ~/agentic-ai/household-expense
bash deploy_household.sh
```

The household app runs on the NAS as `household-api` on port `8088`. The deploy script builds the Vue PWA, copies icons into `household-expense/dist`, rsyncs to `/volume1/docker/household-expense`, rebuilds the NAS Docker container, and verifies `/api/household/health`.

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://192.168.1.44:8088/api/household/health
curl -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/household/settings
```

### Import And Backup

```bash
python3 -m finance.importer --dry-run
python3 -m finance.importer
python3 -m finance.importer --overwrite
python3 -m finance.backup --kind manual
```

`finance.importer` reads `output/xls/ALL_TRANSACTIONS.xlsx` and writes to `data/finance.db`.

NAS automation defaults:

- NAS SSH user: `chfun`
- NAS SSH port: `22`
- Finance replica sync target: `chfun@192.168.1.44:/volume1/finance/finance_readonly.db`
- Local sudo password file for NAS automation: `secrets/nas_sudo_password`

## Process Local PDF Workflow

Use Settings -> Process Local PDFs in the PWA for manual processing.

1. Drop PDFs into `data/pdf_inbox/` or use already-unlocked files in `data/pdf_unlocked/`.
2. Open Settings -> Process Local PDFs.
3. Open PDF Workspace.
4. Select specific files, or leave none selected to process all ready files.
5. Click Process Selected / Process Ready PDFs.
6. The PWA runs preflight, queues all files, polls each job, and shows per-file status.

Status meanings:

| Status | Action |
|---|---|
| `new` | Ready to process. |
| `pending` | Queued. |
| `running` | Processing. |
| `done` | Fully processed. |
| `partial` | Main parse succeeded; secondary write failed. Inspect details. |
| `error` | Processing failed. Inspect details and bridge logs. |
| `missing_source` | Registry row points to a PDF that no longer exists. |

## Preflight Validation

The PWA calls `GET /api/pdf/preflight`, which proxies bridge `GET /pdf/preflight`, before queueing work.

Preflight checks:

- bridge initialized its PDF handler config
- provider order contains only supported providers
- PDF inbox and unlocked folders exist
- bridge job database is reachable
- runtime diagnostics are available

Manual checks:

```bash
TOKEN=$(cat secrets/bridge.token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:9100/pdf/preflight | python3 -m json.tool

curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/pdf/preflight | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Config Validation

Main config file: `config/settings.toml`.

Important sections:

| Section | Used by |
|---|---|
| `[bridge]` | Bridge host, port, log level. |
| `[auth]` | Bridge token source and file/keychain settings. |
| `[mail]` | Mail source and Gmail secrets. |
| `[classifier]` | Provider order and rule loading. |
| `[pdf]` | PDF folders, password source, job DB, verification. |
| `[pipeline]` | Scheduled PDF/import/backup pipeline. |
| `[finance]` | SQLite DB path and XLSX input. |
| `[fastapi]` | Finance API host, port, CORS. |
| `[ollama_finance]` | Finance categorization AI settings. |
| `[household]` | Household satellite base URL and API key file. |
| `[coretax]` | CoreTax template/output dirs, match mode, rounding, owner and institution aliases. |

Validate TOML syntax:

```bash
python3 -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('config/settings.toml','rb')); print('OK')"
```

Validate provider configuration:

```bash
python3 -c "from agent.app.providers import PROVIDERS; print(sorted(PROVIDERS))"
```

## Secrets

macOS Keychain is the source of truth. `secrets/` files are runtime/export artifacts for Docker and local scripts.

Common commands:

```bash
python3 -m bridge.secret_manager init
python3 scripts/export-secrets-for-docker.py
bash scripts/export-secrets-for-docker.sh
```

Expected secret files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `secrets/bridge.token` | Bridge bearer token. |
| `secrets/gmail.toml` | Gmail app passwords if file fallback is used. |
| `secrets/banks.toml` | Bank PDF passwords if file fallback is used. |
| `secrets/nas_sync_key` | NAS SSH private key. |
| `secrets/nas_sudo_password` | Synology sudo password used by NAS deploy scripts. |
| `secrets/finance_api.key` | Exported finance API key used by NAS finance deploy script. |

`secrets/bridge.token` must be a file, not a directory, and should have mode `600`.

## Logs

| Log | Command |
|---|---|
| Bridge app log | `tail -f logs/bridge.log` |
| Docker finance API | `docker compose logs -f finance-api` |
| Docker mail agent | `docker compose logs -f mail-agent` |
| Batch processor | `tail -f logs/batch_process.log` |

LaunchAgent stdout/stderr locations depend on the installed plist. Check `launchd/` and the plist `StandardOutPath` / `StandardErrorPath` values.

## Maintenance

Backups:

- The finance DB is backed up with SQLite online backup helpers.
- Manual backups can be triggered from Settings or `python3 -m finance.backup --kind manual`.
- NAS sync uses SSH and the configured NAS target.
- Current default NAS sync target is `chfun@192.168.1.44:/volume1/finance/finance_readonly.db`.
- `finance.backup` now uses SSH port `22` by default; override with `NAS_SYNC_SSH_PORT` only if the NAS SSH port changes.

PDF registry:

- Processed files are tracked by SHA-256, so renaming a file does not make it new.
- `missing_source` means a registry entry points to a file no longer on disk.
- Failed jobs can be retried after correcting parser/config/password issues.

PWA cache:

- Mobile/offline GET caching is intentional.
- Settings includes a Refresh Mobile Data action.
- PDF endpoints are network-only or freshness-forced so local processing state does not come from stale cache.

Household maintenance:

- `household-expense/data/household.db` is separate from `data/finance.db`.
- Household transactions are soft-deleted with `is_deleted`.
- Settings -> Household Expense manages categories, recent expense category corrections, and cash pools through the finance API proxy.
- The household API key is loaded from `household-expense/secrets/household_api.key` via `[household].api_key_file`.
- Reconciliation import into the main finance model should be verified before documenting it as fully automated.

## CoreTax SPT Workflow

Use PWA → CoreTax SPT for the annual Indonesian DJP tax return (SPT) export.

1. Drop the current year's template into `data/coretax/templates/` (e.g. `CoreTax 2025.xlsx`).
2. Ensure PWM has `account_balances` and `holdings` rows for the relevant snapshot date (typically the last day of the tax year).
3. Navigate to **CoreTax SPT** in the PWA.
4. Set the **Reporting Period** (start and end month — end month determines the snapshot date).
5. Pick the template from the dropdown.
6. Click **Preview (dry run)** to review the confidence breakdown:
   - Filled rows, unmatched rows, aggregated rows, currency warnings, and unused PWM accounts.
7. Expand unmatched rows and resolve any mismatches (owner alias gaps, institution alias gaps, missing PWM data).
8. Click **Generate XLSX** — the browser downloads `CoreTax_YEAR_SNAPSHOT_vN.xlsx` and the server writes the same file plus a `.audit.json` sidecar to `data/coretax/output/`.
9. Click **Download audit log** to retrieve the sidecar for offline review.

CLI equivalent (dry run):

```bash
python3 -c "
from pathlib import Path
from finance.coretax_export import generate_coretax_xlsx
r = generate_coretax_xlsx(
    Path('data/coretax/templates/CoreTax 2025.xlsx'),
    None,
    '2025-12-31',
    Path('data/finance.db'),
    dry_run=True,
)
print(f'filled={r.filled_count} unmatched={r.unmatched_count} currency_warnings={r.currency_warning_count}')
"
```

Adding or adjusting institution/owner mappings — edit `config/settings.toml` under `[coretax.institution_aliases]` and `[coretax.owner_aliases]`. Changes take effect on the next server start (no rebuild needed for config-only changes unless running in Docker).

NAS replica: `dry_run=true` is always available. `dry_run=false` is blocked under `FINANCE_READ_ONLY=true` (returns 403).
