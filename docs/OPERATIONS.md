# Operations

How to run, validate, and maintain the system. Architecture details live in [SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](SYSTEM_DESIGN.md); symptom-driven fixes live in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Common Commands

### Bridge

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m bridge.server
```

The bridge runs on the Mac host, not inside Docker. It exposes `http://127.0.0.1:9100` or the configured host/port in `config/settings.toml`.

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9100/healthz
TOKEN=$(cat secrets/bridge.token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:9100/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Finance API

```bash
python3 -m finance.server
python3 -m finance.server --reload
```

Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f finance-api
```

Always rebuild the Docker image after Python changes. A container restart alone does not pick up changed source files baked into the image.

### PWA

```bash
cd pwa
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

`pwa/dist/` must exist before building production Docker images that serve the PWA from FastAPI.

### Household Expense PWA

```bash
cd household-expense/pwa
npm install
npm run build

cd ~/agentic-ai/household-expense
bash deploy_household.sh
```

The household app runs on the NAS as `household-api` on port `8088`. The deploy script builds the Vue PWA, copies icons into `household-expense/dist`, rsyncs to `/volume1/docker/household-expense`, rebuilds the NAS Docker container, and verifies `/api/household/health`.

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://192.168.1.44:8088/api/household/health
curl -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/household/settings
```

### Import And Backup

```bash
python3 -m finance.importer --dry-run
python3 -m finance.importer
python3 -m finance.importer --overwrite
python3 -m finance.backup --kind manual
```

`finance.importer` reads `output/xls/ALL_TRANSACTIONS.xlsx` and writes to `data/finance.db`.

NAS automation defaults:

- NAS SSH user: `chfun`
- NAS SSH port: `22`
- Finance replica sync target: `chfun@192.168.1.44:/volume1/finance/finance_readonly.db`
- Local sudo password file for NAS automation: `secrets/nas_sudo_password`

## Process Local PDF Workflow

Use Settings -> Process Local PDFs in the PWA for manual processing.

1. Drop PDFs into `data/pdf_inbox/` or use already-unlocked files in `data/pdf_unlocked/`.
2. Open Settings -> Process Local PDFs.
3. Open PDF Workspace.
4. Select specific files, or leave none selected to process all ready files.
5. Click Process Selected / Process Ready PDFs.
6. The PWA runs preflight, queues all files, polls each job, and shows per-file status.

Status meanings:

| Status | Action |
|---|---|
| `new` | Ready to process. |
| `pending` | Queued. |
| `running` | Processing. |
| `done` | Fully processed. |
| `partial` | Main parse succeeded; secondary write failed. Inspect details. |
| `error` | Processing failed. Inspect details and bridge logs. |
| `missing_source` | Registry row points to a PDF that no longer exists. |

## Preflight Validation

The PWA calls `GET /api/pdf/preflight`, which proxies bridge `GET /pdf/preflight`, before queueing work.

Preflight checks:

- bridge initialized its PDF handler config
- provider order contains only supported providers
- PDF inbox and unlocked folders exist
- bridge job database is reachable
- runtime diagnostics are available

Manual checks:

```bash
TOKEN=$(cat secrets/bridge.token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:9100/pdf/preflight | python3 -m json.tool

curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/pdf/preflight | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Config Validation

Main config file: `config/settings.toml`.

Important sections:

| Section | Used by |
|---|---|
| `[bridge]` | Bridge host, port, log level. |
| `[auth]` | Bridge token source and file/keychain settings. |
| `[mail]` | Mail source and Gmail secrets. |
| `[classifier]` | Provider order and rule loading. |
| `[pdf]` | PDF folders, password source, job DB, verification. |
| `[pipeline]` | Scheduled PDF/import/backup pipeline. |
| `[finance]` | SQLite DB path and XLSX input. |
| `[fastapi]` | Finance API host, port, CORS. |
| `[ollama_finance]` | Finance categorization AI settings. |
| `[household]` | Household satellite base URL and API key file. |
| `[coretax]` | CoreTax template/output dirs. Legacy match/rounding/alias keys are no longer used by the persistent ledger. |

Validate TOML syntax:

```bash
python3 -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('config/settings.toml','rb')); print('OK')"
```

Validate provider configuration:

```bash
python3 -c "from agent.app.providers import PROVIDERS; print(sorted(PROVIDERS))"
```

## Matching Engine Operations

The generic matching engine stores per-domain mappings and audit data in `matching_*` tables. Parser routing, dedup, and categorization engine paths are intentionally flag-gated during rollout:

| Flag | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `PARSER_USE_ENGINE` | `true` / `false` | Route PDFs through the parser matching domain before legacy fallback. |
| `DEDUP_USE_ENGINE` | `true` / `false` | Use the dedup domain for parser-variant reconciliation during import. |
| `CATEGORIZATION_USE_ENGINE` | `false` / `shadow` / `true` | `shadow` logs Tier-1 disagreements while returning legacy results; `true` allows Tier-1 cached categorization. |
| `MATCHING_ENABLED_<DOMAIN>` | `true` / `false` | Runtime-config default for generic engine domain status where callers use `finance.matching.runtime_config`. |

Useful API probes:

```bash
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/matching/stats | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/matching/parser/mappings?limit=20" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/matching/shadow-diffs?limit=20" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/matching/invariant-log?limit=20" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Validation:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/matching -q
python3 -m pytest tests/test_categorizer.py tests/test_importer_duplicate_reconcile.py tests/matching -q
```

Operational notes:

- Keep legacy flags off unless actively testing a domain rollout.
- Use `CATEGORIZATION_USE_ENGINE=shadow` before `true`; shadow mode records disagreements in `category_shadow_diff`.
- A missing mapping confirmation should return `404 mapping_not_found`; unexpected 500s on `/api/matching/*` are bugs.
- Dynamic matching table access must go through `finance.matching.storage`; do not hand-build `matching_<domain>` SQL in new code unless the domain is validated by API allow-list or storage helpers.

## Secrets

macOS Keychain is the source of truth. `secrets/` files are runtime/export artifacts for Docker and local scripts.

Common commands:

```bash
python3 -m bridge.secret_manager init
python3 scripts/export-secrets-for-docker.py
bash scripts/export-secrets-for-docker.sh
```

Expected secret files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `secrets/bridge.token` | Bridge bearer token. |
| `secrets/gmail.toml` | Gmail app passwords if file fallback is used. |
| `secrets/banks.toml` | Bank PDF passwords if file fallback is used. |
| `secrets/nas_sync_key` | NAS SSH private key. |
| `secrets/nas_sudo_password` | Synology sudo password used by NAS deploy scripts. |
| `secrets/finance_api.key` | Exported finance API key used by NAS finance deploy script. |

`secrets/bridge.token` must be a file, not a directory, and should have mode `600`.

## Logs

| Log | Command |
|---|---|
| Bridge app log | `tail -f logs/bridge.log` |
| Docker finance API | `docker compose logs -f finance-api` |
| Docker mail agent | `docker compose logs -f mail-agent` |
| Batch processor | `tail -f logs/batch_process.log` |

LaunchAgent stdout/stderr locations depend on the installed plist. Check `launchd/` and the plist `StandardOutPath` / `StandardErrorPath` values.

## Maintenance

Backups:

- The finance DB is backed up with SQLite online backup helpers.
- Manual backups can be triggered from Settings or `python3 -m finance.backup --kind manual`.
- NAS sync uses SSH and the configured NAS target.
- Current default NAS sync target is `chfun@192.168.1.44:/volume1/finance/finance_readonly.db`.
- `finance.backup` now uses SSH port `22` by default; override with `NAS_SYNC_SSH_PORT` only if the NAS SSH port changes.

PDF registry:

- Processed files are tracked by SHA-256, so renaming a file does not make it new.
- `missing_source` means a registry entry points to a file no longer on disk.
- Failed jobs can be retried after correcting parser/config/password issues.

PWA cache:

- Mobile/offline GET caching is intentional.
- Settings includes a Refresh Mobile Data action.
- PDF endpoints are network-only or freshness-forced so local processing state does not come from stale cache.

Household maintenance:

- `household-expense/data/household.db` is separate from `data/finance.db`.
- Household transactions are soft-deleted with `is_deleted`.
- Settings -> Household Expense manages categories, recent expense category corrections, and cash pools through the finance API proxy.
- The household API key is loaded from `household-expense/secrets/household_api.key` via `[household].api_key_file`.
- Reconciliation import into the main finance model should be verified before documenting it as fully automated.

## CoreTax SPT Workflow

Use PWA → CoreTax SPT for the annual Indonesian DJP tax return (SPT) export.

The current implementation is a persistent tax-version ledger. It is not a one-shot template filler. SQLite stores reviewed tax values, lock flags, learned mappings, import staging rows, and reconcile history.

1. Confirm the canonical export template exists under `data/coretax/templates/`. Keep it chart/image-free because `openpyxl` does not roundtrip those reliably.
2. Upload the prior-year submitted SPT XLSX in the **Import Previous SPT** tab. For example, a workbook with headers `E=2025` and `F=2026` must be uploaded with `target_tax_year=2026`.
3. Review staged rows. The staging table preserves raw Excel cells for B/H descriptions and E/F/G values so the import can be audited before commit.
4. Commit staging to create `coretax_rows` for the target tax year. Sticky codes carry forward; refreshable codes stay unset.
5. Use **Review** to edit rows or lock/unlock fields. Any manual edit to `current_amount_idr` or `market_value_idr` auto-locks that field.
6. Use **Mapping** before reconcile. The live unmapped list is computed from current PWM rows and learned mappings, not from the last reconcile run. Map PWM items to existing rows, create rows for genuinely new tax rows, or run suggestions and preview high-confidence bulk accepts.
7. Use **Reconcile from PWM** with the relevant month range. Reconcile reads `account_balances`, `holdings`, and `liabilities` for the snapshot date and only writes unlocked fields. It applies explicit mappings first, then safe 1:1 heuristics (unique ISIN or account-number matches) that can be learned as `auto_safe` mappings.
8. Use **Export CoreTax XLSX**. The API writes `CoreTax_{tax_year}_vN.xlsx` plus `CoreTax_{tax_year}_vN.audit.json` under `data/coretax/output/` and returns only `file_id`, `download_url`, and `audit_url`.

Carry-forward defaults:

| Kode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `012`, `034`, `036`, `039` | Refreshable from PWM; committed with `current_amount_idr = NULL`. |
| `038`, `042`, `043`, `051`, `061` | Sticky/acquisition-cost rows; committed with `current_amount_idr = prior_amount_idr`. |

Useful API probes:

```bash
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/coretax/summary?tax_year=2026" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/coretax/rows?tax_year=2026" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/coretax/2026/unmapped-pwm" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/coretax/mappings/lifecycle?year=2026" | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "X-Api-Key: $FINANCE_API_KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/coretax/reconcile-runs?tax_year=2026" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Mapping notes:

- Mapping fingerprints are generated by `finance/coretax/fingerprint.py`; do not hand-type hashes unless debugging.
- `account_number_norm` values are SHA-256 hashes of `institution_norm:account_norm`; use `fingerprint_raw` in API responses for audit/display.
- `isin` values are stored as normalized ISINs.
- `holding_signature` and `liability_signature` are more volatile because they include editable names; expect lower confidence and lifecycle review.
- Mapping assignment conflicts return HTTP 409 with structured details instead of silently retargeting a source fingerprint.
- Rejected suggestions are remembered in `coretax_rejected_suggestions`; use the Mapping tab controls to reverse or manually override them.

Reconcile notes:

- `CORETAX_LEGACY_HEURISTICS` defaults to off. Only enable it temporarily for migration/debugging because it can attach rows by weaker substring or single-row heuristics.
- Component history is retained in `coretax_row_components`. Current components have `is_current=1`; older run components are kept with `is_current=0` for run diff/debugging.
- Low-confidence mapping matches are allowed but should be reviewed in the Mapping tab.

CLI smoke test using a local workbook and scratch DB:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path
from finance.coretax.db import ensure_coretax_tables
from finance.coretax.import_parser import parse_prior_year_xlsx
from finance.coretax.carry_forward import commit_staging_batch

workbook = Path('/Users/g4ndr1k/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Finance/SPT/2025/CoreTax 2025.xlsx')
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
ensure_coretax_tables(conn)
result = parse_prior_year_xlsx(workbook, 2026, conn)
print(result['row_count'], 'rows staged')
print(commit_staging_batch(conn, result['batch_id'], 2026))
PY
```

NAS replica: all CoreTax write endpoints are blocked under `FINANCE_READ_ONLY=true` and return 403. GET endpoints remain available for review/download of already-synced data.
